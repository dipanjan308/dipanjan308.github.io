Hi, Iâ€™m Dipanjan Mandal, a post-doctoral fellow at Department of Physical and Chemical Sciences, [University of L'Aquila](https://www.dsfc.univaq.it/en/department), L'Aquila, Italy. I joined here in November 2024. Currently I am working on dynamical and equilibrium properties of different chemical systems using machine learend inter-atomic potentials with the supervision of [Prof. Carlo Pierleoni](https://www.aquila.infn.it/cpierleo/). Prior to this I was a post-doctoral research associate from 2019-2024 at Department of Physics, [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/), Coventry, UK. My research area is broadly in Statistical Physics. At Warwick, I worked with [Prof. David Quigley](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/research/dquigley/), where I studied the nucleation properties of simple lattice-gas models in the presence of static or dynamic impurities. We also explored different roles played by impurities at the time of droplet formation. These could be surfactant, bulk-stabilizer, nucleant or inert-spectator. During my PhD, at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.imsc.res.in/), India, I studied the entropy driven phase transitions and critical properties of the system hard particles with different geometrical shapes on lattice, under the supervision of [Prof. R. Rajesh](https://sites.google.com/view/rrajeshshomepage/home). Immediately after my PhD, I was a post-doctoral fellow at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifrh.res.in/), Hyderabad in 2019, working with [Prof. Kabir Ramola](https://www.tifrh.res.in/~kramola/) on active random walk.
